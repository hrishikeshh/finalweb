      <description>Abstract Every year, traffic accidents due to human errors cause increasing amounts of deaths and injuries globally. To help reduce the amount of fatalities, in the paper presented here, a new module for Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) which deals with automatic driver drowsiness detection based on visual information and Artificial Intelligence is presented.
The aim of this system is to locate, track, and analyze both the drivers face and eyes to compute a drowsiness index, where this real-time system works under varying light conditions (diurnal and nocturnal driving).</description>

      <description>Background The U.S. Department of Education launched College Scorecard in September 2015 as a means of gathering more data on degree-granting institutions, the demographics of college students, and the status of alumni of these institutions [1]. By doing so, the U.S. Department of Education hopes to empower students to make more informed college decisions through a data-driven approach. Considering the soaring cost of higher education as well as the accompanying rise of student debt, prospective students can greatly benefit from such information.</description>

      <description>Abstract The reproducibility of experiments has been a long standing impediment for further scientific progress. Computational methods have been instrumental in drug discovery efforts owing to its multifaceted utilization for data collection, pre-processing, analysis and inference. This article provides an in-depth coverage on the reproducibility of computational drug discovery. This review explores the following topics: (1) the current state-of-the-art on reproducible research, (2) research documentation (e.g. electronic laboratory notebook, Jupyter notebook, etc.</description>

      <description>Abstract:1 Crypto currencies are considered as the next model of economics and monetary exchange. In recent years, popular cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and Ethereum witness an exponential growth in economic sphere. In this paper empirical testing of four conventional machine learning methods is performed to predict the bitcoin prices using last eight years of transactional data. Linear and polynomial regression is implemented using all the features individually. Polynomial regression, Support Vector regression and KNN regression are hyper tuned with grid search logic.</description>

      <description>Abstract Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which leads to the gradual loss of neuronal cells. Several hypotheses for AD exists (e.g., cholinergic, amyloid, tau hypotheses, etc.). As per the cholinergic hypothesis, the deficiency of choline is responsible for AD; therefore, the inhibition of AChE is a lucrative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that is essential for cognition and memory.</description>

      <description>Introduction So you probably have heard of the term Bioinformatics before, but did not get the chance to learn more about what it is and what it can do.
In this article, I will be giving you a brief high-level overview of this exciting field of Bioinformatics. Thus, the article will be comprehensible to those coming from biology or computer backgrounds alike.
As a biologist, I have self-taught myself data science and coding (R and Python) after several years of persistence (initially quitting a couple of times the coding concept just kind of clicked at some point in time).</description>
